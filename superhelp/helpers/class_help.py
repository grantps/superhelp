        A good discussion of getters, setters, and properties can be found at
        [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)

        Getters and setters are usually added in other languages such as Java
        because direct attribute access doesn't give the ability to calculate
        results or otherwise run a process when a value is accessed / written.

        And it is common for lots of getters and setters to be added, whether or
        not they are actually needed - Just In Case{tm}. The fear is that if you
        point other code to an attribute, and you later need to process the
        attribute or derive it before it is served up or stored, then you'll
        need to make a breaking change to your code. All the client code
        referencing the attribute will have to be rewritten to replace direct
        access with a reference to the appropriate getter or setter.
        Understandably then the inclination is to point to a getter or setter in
        the first case even if it doesn't actually do anything different (for
        now at least) from direct access. Using these getters and setters is
        wasteful, and bloats code unnecessarily, but it avoids the worse evil of
        regularly broken interfaces. The benefit is that you can change
        implementation later if you need to and nothing will break. But in
        Python there is a much better way :-).

            We must define the getter earlier in the script than the setter
            because the setter references the getter name. If it is not already
            defined above it we will get a `NameError` because Python doesn't
            yet know the variable_name part of the `@<variable_name>.setter`.

            In the `\_\_init\_\_` method we can either directly set the
            "private" variable `self.__name` (note - unenforced in Python)
            or set the public variable `self.name` and pass through the
            setter. Passing through the setter makes more sense - presumably
            there are some smarts in the setter we want applied otherwise we
            wouldn't have gone to the trouble of making it ;-).

            You will have also noticed that the method name is defined twice
            without the second one overwriting the first (the standard
