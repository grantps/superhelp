            If you have a tuple of mutable data e.g. lists, the content of those
            lists can be altered even while it remains true that you can't
            replace, remove, or add items inside the tuple.

            `guests` is now {original_guests}. And because `guests` is immutable
            we can't add, remove, or replace its items. But look what happens to
            the `guests` tuple when we append a person to friends:

            layout(f"""\

            `guests` is now {guests}. An immutable data structure has changed!
            In reality it is the references to individual items that are
            immutable e.g. a reference to the memory address where a mutable
            list sits.

            #### Named tuples

            Tuples are a light-weight way of defining and storing data. It is
            easier, for example, to write `coord` = (-37, 174) than it is to
            write `coord` = {{'lat': -37, 'lon': 174}}. But it can be risky
            consuming data from tuples in later code if the order or number of
            items changes. What if the tuples you are processing change from
            (lat, lon) to (lon, lat)? References to coord[0] would have changed
            meaning without it being obvious. There can be a high risk of bugs.

            Named tuples retain the light-weight advantages of plain vanilla
            tuples but enable us to use a dot notation to reference internal
            items e.g. house_lat = coord.lat. Named tuples also contain
            information on their contents when printed / logged which can make
            debugging much easier.

            There is no consensus on how to pronounce tuple. Should it rhyme
            with cup or with hoop? People from a more mathematical background
            often prefer "toople". Others prefer to follow the spelling and say
            "tupple".
