    Lambdas are commonly overused so it is worth reading

        Lambda functions are anonymous functions. They have no name or
        documentation so should only be used where their brevity pros outweigh
        their readability cons.

        In their favour, lambdas are idiomatic when used as the key in sorting
        operations. They are also commonly relied upon when using libraries like
        Pandas (albeit not always wisely).

        Sometimes the alternatives are arguably worse. Consider the following
        alternatives - in this case it may be difficult to improve on the
        lambda:

        #### Use `lambda`

        #### Alternative 1) use `operator` module

        Lambdas are a clear mistake when they add nothing or when they become
        too complex.

        Lambdas add nothing apart from confusion and noise when they merely
        apply a function. In the following examples both lines in each pair

        The main rule with lambdas is to avoid them unless they make the code
        more readable. And if you must use them, remember that you can still use
        names that convey some meaning - for example `s` for string, `t` for
        tuple, `d` for dict, `l` for list, `nt` for namedtuple, `row` for a row
        etc. They will make the logic more intelligible and make mistakes more
        obvious. For example, x[-1] might be what was intended but it would be
        easier to tell if we saw:

        `lambda l: l[-1]`  ## obviously the last item of a list

        or `lambda s: s[-1]`  ## obviously the last character of a string

        or `lambda d: d[-1]`  ## probably a mistake unless -1 is a key

        Of course, longer names should be used if they help.

    Trey Hunner's [Overusing lambda expressions in Python](https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions/) is well
    worth reading. The position taken in SuperHELP differs in some regards but
    has been influenced by Trey's thinking.

    If using functions from the `operator` module (`itemgetter`, `attrgetter`,
    and `methodcaller`) becomes more common and idiomatic then it could be time
    to substantially reduce the usage of `lambda`.
