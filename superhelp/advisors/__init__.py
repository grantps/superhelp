"""
Add advisors modules inside this folder.

To add more advice, just declare more advisor functions inside the advisors
modules with the @..._advisor decorators :-). Make sure the first paragraph of
the docstring is a good, user-facing description of its purpose so it can be
automatically processed into lists of available advice in SuperHELP.

The basic pattern within an advisor function is:

* Get the correct elements and see if the target pattern is found e.g. a value
  being assigned to a name

* If not, exit returning None

* Otherwise create all the different message parts ready to assemble in the
  message.

  Some parts will have two versions - one for the first time the message appears
  for a block of the code snippet; and one for subsequent appearances. These
  "repeat" versions are sometimes empty strings; other times they are simply
  much shorter versions.

  Don't manually try to dedent etc the message parts - use the layout_comment
  function and follow the example of other advisor modules. It is very easy to
  break markdown in ways which mess up the terminal output.

* Assemble the message. There can be up to three parts: brief, main, and extra.
  Only the brief component is mandatory. If not supplied, the main component is
  just a repeat of the brief component.

* Add to the appropriate test module. Only test advisors within the module.

    Some aspects of code apply to lots of different parts of the code base e.g.
    logging, or security. These can be thought of as "cross-cutting concerns"
    from an Aspect-Oriented Programming point of view. The problem is that a lot
    of code gets repeated e.g. if every function has to implement its own
    logging or has to handle its own security. Even if there is some shared
    functionality it can often require special wiring into other code. In
    short, coping with cross-cutting concerns can be painful.

    Decorators and Context Managers are ways Python provides of concentrating
    cross-cutting concerns into single pieces of code in an elegant way. They
    DRY out your code (see
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>). And because they
    are very widely used, it is worth learning how to use them, even if you
    don't take the step of writing your own.

    Comprehensions are one the great things about Python. To see why, have a

    the rationale. In short, if the goal of your code can be expressed as a
    single English sentence then it might belong on one line. The code should
    say what it is doing more than how it is doing it. Comprehensions are
    declarative and that is A Very Good Thingâ„¢.

    Pro tip: don't make comprehensions *in*comprehensions ;-). If your
