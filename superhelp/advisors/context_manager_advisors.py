        For example, every time we open a file we need to make sure it is closed
        when we are finished. It is not that hard to handle that yourself in
        simple cases but can become much harder - perhaps the code exits in
        multiple places (perhaps as a result of an `exception`). You have to
        remember to handle the tidy-up in every place an exit might occur.
        Either you will forget one of them or you'll be repeating code all over
        the place violating the DRY principle - namely:

        WET presumably stands for "Write Every Time", "Write Everything Twice",
        "We Enjoy Typing" or "Waste Everyone's Time" ;-)

        If you don't use a context manager, problems can emerge as a snippet
        gradually evolves. And it usually all starts so innocently :-). Here's
        one example of the problem unfolding:

        f = open(fname)
