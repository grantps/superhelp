                #### GOTCHA - immutable means 100% unchangeable right?

                If you have a tuple of mutable data e.g. lists, the content
                of those lists can be altered even while it remains true that you
                can't replace, remove, or add items inside the tuple.

                Demonstration:

                """)

                `guests` is now {original_guests}. And because `guests` is
                immutable we can't add, remove, or replace its items. But look
                what happens to the `guests` tuple when we append a person to
                friends:

                `guests` is now {guests}. An immutable data structure has
                changed! In reality it is the references to individual items
                that are immutable e.g. a reference to the memory address where
                a mutable list sits.

                #### Named tuples

                Tuples are a light-weight way of defining and storing data. It
                is easier, for example, to write `coord` = (-37, 174) than it is
                to write `coord` = {{'lat': -37, 'lon': 174}}. But it can be
                risky consuming data from tuples in later code if the order or
                number of items changes. What if the tuples you are processing
                change from (lat, lon) to (lon, lat)? References to coord[0]
                would have changed meaning without it being obvious. There can
                be a high risk of bugs.

                Named tuples retain the light-weight advantages of plain vanilla
                tuples but enable us to use a dot notation to reference internal
                items e.g. house_lat = coord.lat. Named tuples also contain
                information on their contents when printed / logged which can
                make debugging much easier.

                print(coord)

                #### "Tupple" vs "Toople"

                There is no consensus on how to pronounce tuple. Should it rhyme
                with cup or with hoop? People from a more mathematical
                background often prefer "toople". Others prefer to follow the
                spelling and say "tupple".
