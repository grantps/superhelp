## Overview

SuperHELP is Help for Humans! The goal is to provide customised help for
simple code snippets. SuperHELP is not intended to replace the built-in Python
help but to supplement it for basic Python code structures. SuperHELP will
also be opinionated. Help can be provided in a variety of contexts including
the terminal and web browsers (perhaps as part of on-line tutorials).

## Quick Start

Click the button below to open a Binder Jupyter Notebook you can play around
in e.g. get advice on a snippet or line of Python

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgrantps%2Fsuperhelp.git/master?filepath=notebooks%2FSuperhelpDemo.ipynb)

or put the following at the top of your Python script and run the script:

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this()

## Installation

Note - Python 3.6+ only. If you have an older version of Python use the Binder
Jupyter Notebook button instead (see higher up)

To install

1) Use pip e.g.

    $ pip3 install superhelp

or similar

    $ python3 -m pip install superhelp

2) Or clone the repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/grantps/superhelp.git
    $ python3 setup.py install

## Example Use Cases

* Charlotte likes to check her code before others see it so includes

        import superhelp
        superhelp.this(warnings_only=True)

    at the top of each script. When she is happy with the code she comments
    those two lines out.

* Avi is a Python beginner and wants to get advice on a five-line
function he wrote to display greetings to a list of people. He learns about
Python conventions for variable naming and better ways of combining strings.

* Zach wants to get advice on a named tuple. He learns how to add doc strings
to individual fields.

* Noor is considering submitting some code to Stack Overflow but wants to
improve it first (or possibly get ideas for a solution directly). She discovers
that a list comprehension might work. She also becomes aware of dictionary
comprehensions for the first time.

* Al has written a simple Python decorator but is wanting to see if there is
anything which can be improved. He learns how to use functool.wrap from an
example provided.

* Moana is an experienced Python developer but tends to forget things like doc
strings in her functions. She learns a standard approach and starts using it
more often. Moana also finds the summarised linting useful.

* Paul wants to check the quality of some code before including it in his
project. He learns about some issues and makes improvements before integrating
it.

## Using SuperHELP on the Notebook

Add new cell at end with content like:

    %%shelp
    
    def sorted(my_list):
        sorted_list = my_list.sort()
        return sorted_list

and run it to get advice.

The notebook has more detailed instructions at the top.

## Using SuperHELP on a Local Installation

### Inside your script

Put the following at the top of your script and then run the script (note - there are two underscores on either side of file):

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this()

If you don't want the default web output you can specify another output such as 'cli' (command line interface) or 'md' (markdown):

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this(output='md')

If you don't want the default 'Extra' level of messages you can specify a different detail level ('Brief' or 'Main') e.g.

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this(detail_level='Brief')

or:

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this(detail_level='Main')

If you only want to see warnings you can specify warnings only e.g.

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this(warnings_only=True)

If you don't want your code executed while SuperHELP is evaluating it

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this(execute_code=False)

You can use as many options as you want e.g.

    import superhelp
    superhelp.this(output='md', execute_code=False, warnings_only=True)

### From the command line (terminal / console)

    $ shelp -h  ## get extended help on usage (purpose, defaults, etc)

    $ shelp --code "people = ['Tomas', 'Sal', 'Raj']" --output html --detail-level Main
    $ shelp -c "people = ['Tomas', 'Sal', 'Raj']" -o html -d Main

    $ shelp --file-path my_script.py --output cli --theme light --detail-level Extra
    $ shelp -f my_snippet.py -o cli -t light -d Extra

    $ shelp --project-path /home/g/proj --exclude-folders env
    $ shelp -p /home/g/proj -e env

    $ shelp --file-path my_script.py --warnings-only
    $ shelp -f my_snippet.py -w

    $ shelp --file-path my_script.py --execute-code True
    $ shelp -f my_snippet.py -x True

    $ shelp  ## to see advice on an example snippet displayed (detail level 'Extra')

    $ shelp --advice-list  ## to see all types of help listed
    $ shelp -a
    
## Stretch Ideas

* Extend beyond standard library into popular libraries like requests, bottle, flask etc.
