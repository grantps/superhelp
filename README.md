# Superhelp

## Overview

Superhelp is Help for Humans! The goal is to provide customised help for simple code snippets. Superhelp is not intended to replace the built-in Python help but to supplement it for basic Python code structures. Superhelp will also be opinionated. Help can be provided in a variety of contexts including the terminal and web browsers (perhaps as part of a on-line tutorials). 

## Requirements

Python 3.6+ and requirements.txt

## Usage

    python helper.py -s "people = ['Tomas', 'Sal', 'Raj']" -d html -l Main

## TODO

Assuming users find value in the tool, and there is no specific direction arising from discount usability testing, I'll add coverage of:

* sets
* if-elif-else (always else - even if to raise an exception)
* exceptions (specific is best)
* sorting (sort() vs sorted() and sort(reverse=True) vs reversed)
